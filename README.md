Welcome to my SQL portfolio! As an intermediate beginner passionate about learning and expanding my SQL skills, this repository serves as a platform to showcase my progress in working with various types of queries and exploring different aspects of database management. The projects in this portfolio highlight my growing expertise in data manipulation, extraction, and analysis, while demonstrating my ability to apply SQL techniques to real-world problems. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I aim to further develop my understanding of database design, optimization, and best practices :)
